	abstract = {PolarFS is a distributed file system with ultra-low latency and
	            high availability, designed for the POLARDB database service,
	            which is now available on the Alibaba Cloud. PolarFS utilizes a
	            lightweight network stack and I/O stack in user-space, taking
	            full advantage of the emerging techniques like RDMA, NVMe, and
	            SPDK. In this way, the end-to-end latency of PolarFS has been
	            reduced drastically and our experiments show that the write
	            latency of PolarFS is quite close to that of local file system on
	            SSD. To keep replica consistency while maximizing I/O throughput
	            for PolarFS, we develop ParallelRaft, a consensus protocol
	            derived from Raft, which breaks Raft's strict serialization by
	            exploiting the out-of-order I/O completion tolerance capability
	            of databases. ParallelRaft inherits the understand-ability and
	            easy implementation of Raft while providing much better I/O
	            scalability for PolarFS. We also describe the shared storage
	            architecture of PolarFS, which gives a strong support for
	            POLARDB.},

	abstract = {At the PODC 2001 conference, I got tired of everyone saying how
	            difficult it was to understand the Paxos algorithm, published in
	            [122]. Although people got so hung up in the pseudo-Greek names
	            that they found the paper hard to understand, the algorithm
	            itself is very simple. So, I cornered a couple of people at the
	            conference and explained the algorithm to them orally, with no
	            paper. When I got home, I wrote down the explanation as a short
	            note, which I later revised based on comments from Fred Schneider
	            and Butler Lampson. The current version is 13 pages long, and
	            contains no formula more complicated than n1 > n2.},
