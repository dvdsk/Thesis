	title = {Paxos Made Simple},
	year = {2001},
	month = {December},
	abstract = {At the PODC 2001 conference, I got tired of everyone saying how
	            difficult it was to understand the Paxos algorithm, published in
	            [122]. Although people got so hung up in the pseudo-Greek names
	            that they found the paper hard to understand, the algorithm
	            itself is very simple. So, I cornered a couple of people at the
	            conference and explained the algorithm to them orally, with no
	            paper. When I got home, I wrote down the explanation as a short
	            note, which I later revised based on comments from Fred Schneider
	            and Butler Lampson. The current version is 13 pages long, and
	            contains no formula more complicated than n1 > n2.},
