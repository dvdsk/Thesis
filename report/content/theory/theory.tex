% intro is already handling motivation for dist FS

% filesystem basics
%   - folders ?
%   - open read only vs open read/write
% 	- posix ?
% 	- blocks ?
% 	- Nfs

% distributed computing
%
%

% pitfalls of distributed compute
% 	- clocks, communication failure, node failure => models
%   - consensus + models => strict consensus

% solutions, quorum based
%   - consensus as a service (zookeeper)
% 	- paxos
%   - raft

% existing FS
% 	- GFS, single node so easy
% 	- Hadoop FS HA, opt in consensus
% 	- Ceph, subtree partitioning
