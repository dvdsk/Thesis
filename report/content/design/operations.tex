\subsection{Client requests} %TODO rename leases -> capabilities or get clear on what the difference is
In this section we go over all the operations of the system, while discussing four in greater detail. I also explain how most operations are simplere forms of these four. This section is split in two parts: client requests and coordination by the president.
%
For all requests a client needs to find an offical to talk to. If the request modifies the namespace, such as write, create and delete, the client needs to contact the minister. In \Cref{fig:find_aMDS} we see how this works. Since load balancing changes and minister appointments are communicated through \raft{} each cluster member knows which ministry owns a given subtree. As clients do not know the current \raft{} \textit{term} nor \textit{commit} they can not judge if the information is correct. At worst this means a few extra jumps through irrelivant ministries before they get up to date information.

	\caption{A new client~\clientLeg{} finding the responsible minister~\amdsLeg{} for a file. Its route can go through the wrong subtree~\umdsLeg{} or via the correct ministrie's clerk~\cmdsLeg{}. Whenever there is a choice dotted lines indicate the less likely path.}
	\label{fig:find_aMDS}
\end{figure}
%
\subsection*{Capabilities} 
A client needing write capability on a file contacts the minister. It in turn checks if the lease can be given out and asks its clerks to revoke outstanding read leases that conflict. A read lease conflict when its region overlaps with the region needed for the write capability. If a clerk lost contact with a client it can not revoke the lease and has to wait till the lease expires. The process is illustrated in \Cref{fig:write}. 

If the client needs read capabilities it sends its requests to a clerk. The clerk checks against the \raft{} log if the leases would conflict with an outstanding write lease. If no conflict is found the lease is issued and the connection to the client kept active. Keeping an active connection makes it possible to revoke the lease or quickly refresh it.

	\input{figs/diagrams/write.tex}
	\caption{A client~\clientLeg{} requesting ranged write capabilities. It finds and contacts the responsible minister~\amdsLeg{}. The minister then contacts the ministrie's clerks~\cmdsLeg to clear conflicting read capabilities. Meanwhile it revokes any conflicting write leases it gave out.}
	\label{fig:write}
\end{figure}
%
\subsection*{Namespace Changes}
Most changes to the namespace need simpel edits within ministries metadata table. The client sends its request to the minister. The change is performed by adding a commands to the \ac{praft} log (see: \Cref{sec:praft}). Before committing the change the client gets the log index for the change. If the minister goes down before acknowleding success the client verifies if the change happend using the log index.

Removing a directory spanning one or more load balanced subtrees needs a little more care. One or more ministers will have to delete their entire subtree. This requires coordination across the entire cluster. The clients remove requests is forwarded by the minster to the \textit{president}. It in turn appends \textsl{Subtree Delete} to the cluster wide log. The client recieves the log index for the command to verify success even if the \textit{president} goes down. The steps the minister takes are shown in \Cref{fig:rm}.

	\input{figs/diagrams/del_dir.tex}
	\caption{An minister~\amdsLeg{}, here $\text{Minister}_j$, removes a directory (tree) that is load balanced between multiple ministries. The president~\presidentLeg{} coordinates the removal by appending a command to the log. Once it is committed the ministers hosting subtrees of the directory demote themself to idle and $\text{Ministry}_j$ drops the directory from its db}
	\label{fig:rm}
\end{figure}
%
\subsection{Availibility}
Ensuring file system avalibility is the responsibility of the \textit{president}. This includes replacing nodes that fail and load balancing. All ministers and clerks periodically send heartbeats to the president. In this design I improve scalability by moving tasks from a central authority (the president) to groups of nodes. Continueing this pattern we could let the ministers monitor their clerks. This is more complex then letting these report directly to the \textit{president}. However even reporting directly to the president is not needed, instead I use the TCP ack to the \textit{president}'s \raft{} heartbeat. When the \textit{president} fails to send a \raft{} heartbeat to a node it decides the node must be failing.

\subsubsection*{A failing minister}
When the president notices a minister has failed it will try to replace it. It queries the ministries clerks to find the ideal candidate for promotion. It it gets a response from less then half the ministry it can not safely replace the minister. At that point it marks the file subtree as down and may retry in the future. A succesful replace is illustrated in \Cref{fig:appoint}.

% TODO what if there is no free umds and group gets too small?
% TODO instead wait till load balance check corrects it?
% what to do with nodes quickly going down?
% just check load balance often? (is just calc not the data geathering)
A clerk going down is handled by the president in one of two ways:
\begin{itemize}
	\item There is at least one idle node. The president assigns the idle node to the failing nodes group. 
	\item There are no idle nodes. The president, through raft, commands a clerk in the group with the lowest load to demote itself. Then the president drops the matter. The clerk wait till its read leases expire and unassigns.
\end{itemize}
%
When the groups minister appends to the groups \ac{praft} log it will notice the replacement misses entries and update it (see \cref{sec:raft}).

	\centering
	\input{figs/diagrams/apoint.tex}
	\caption{An minister~\amdsLeg{} fails and does not send a heartbeat on time (1). The president~\presidentLeg{} requests the latest commit index (2). Node $\text{Clerk}_1$~\cmdsLeg{} has index $k$ and it is the highest (3). The president has promoted $\text{Clerk}_1$ to minister, it has started sending heartbeats (4). Note the heartbeats send by the clerks are not shown.}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Load balancing} \label{sec:loadb}
From the point of avalibility a system that is up but drowning in requests might as well be down. To prevent nodes from getting overloaded we actively balance the load between ministries, add and remove them and expand the read capacity of some. A load report contains cpu utilization for each node in the group and the popularity of each bit of metadata split into read and write. The President checks the balance for each report it recieves.
%
\subparagraph*{Tradeoff}
There is a tradeoff here: a larger ministries means more clerks for the minister to communicate changes to, slowing down writes. On the other side as the file system is split into more subtrees the chance increases a client will need to contact not one but multiple ministries. Further more, to create another ministry we ususally have to shrink existing ministries. Growing a ministry can involve removing one to free up clerks. 
%
We can model the read and write capacity of a single group as:
\begin{align}
	r =& n_\text{c} \\
	w =& 1 - \sigma*n_\text{c}
\end{align}%
Here $n_\text{c}$ is the number of clerks in the group, and $\sigma$ the communication overhead added by an extra clerk. 

Now we can derive the number of clerks needed give a load. Since we want to have some unused capacity $\delta$. I set $\delta$ equal to the capacity with the current load subtracted. This gets us the following system of equations: 
\begin{align}
	\delta &= w - W \\
	\delta &= r - R
\end{align}%
Now solve for $n_\text{c}$, the number of clerks.
\begin{align}
	r - R &= w - W \\
	n_c - R &= \left(1 - \sigma*n_c\right) - W \\
	n_c &= \frac{R - W + 1}{1 + \sigma}
\end{align}
From this I draw two conclusions, any spare capacity for writing is at a cost of spare reading capacity. The number of clerks roughly the read load.
%
% TODO a load balancing algorithm
%
\subparagraph*{Read balancing}
A ministry expeciencing low read load relative to their capacity is shrunk. A ministries read load is low if it could lose a clerk without average clerk cpu utilization rising above 85\%. A ministry has multiple members not only for performance. The members form a \ac{praft} cluster and ensure metadata is stored redundantly. This only works if a ministry has at least three members. To shrink a ministry the President issues a \raft{} message unassigning a clerk. 

A group under high relative read load has average clerk cpu utilization passing 95\%. The president then issues a \raft{} message assigning a idle node to the group if one is availible. %TODO diff % why
%
\subparagraph*{Write balancing}
When the president decides a group can no longer handle the write load it will try to split off some work to another group. If no existing group can handle the write work the president will try to create a new group. If that is not possible then the
