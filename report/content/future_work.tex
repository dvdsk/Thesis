% PID for load balancing
% better load balance algorithm
% recover groups if nodes that went down come back
% prep move of subtree opt

% queued report (queued with raft idx)
% on new load report handle directly and remove queued
% queue is orderd on (over)load
% unassigned to low power state?
% only some nodes vote?
% variable redundency (min group size)

% data checksumming and healing

% lock free raft: https://planetscale.com/blog/blog-series-consensus-algorithms-at-scale-part-5

% keep connections between vote win and being president (faster first hb allowes tighter timings)

% parallel raft out of order when requests in different dictories?
